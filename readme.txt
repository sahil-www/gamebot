This is a discord based gaming bot that allows users to play games with each other and also with the bot itself. 
This project is built on python and utilizes discord.py and random modules. Rest of the implementation of functionalities are done from scratch.
Although I created this as a learning project, this bot is fully functional and useful in real discord servers.
Also has a database that stores player's information.
